Lab 2 Memory and Structures

OVERVIEW

This C program uses a in memory database to store and manage part records. The database uses malloc and deallocation (free) to hold the records, this gives it flexible memory management without using arrays. You can add, delete, and view records with the data stored in memory throughout the program.


FEATURES

Add Record: Adds a new part with things like part number, name, size, and cost
Delete Record: Removes the last added part
View All Records: shows all stored parts
View Number of Records: Shows the total number of parts in the database
View Database Size: shows the memory used by the database
Exit: Frees memory and exits the program

MENU OPTIONS

1 Print all records
2 Print number of records

EXTRA CREDIT
Skipped realloc() and instead managed the memory resizing manually (used malloc and just copy the data over yourself).
